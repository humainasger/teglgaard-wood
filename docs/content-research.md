# Teglgaard Wood - Content Research & Planning

## Executive Summary

Teglgaard Wood (formerly trading as Silva Green) is a Danish B2B wholesale Christmas tree trader founded in 1976 by Michael Teglgaard. The company sources premium Nordmann firs from Danish growers and exports to France, Germany, UK, and broader Europe. Michael has bought the company back and is now CEO again - this "back under founder's leadership" narrative is key.

**Key differentiator:** 50 years of trading expertise + pure B2B wholesale focus (no retail competition with customers).
